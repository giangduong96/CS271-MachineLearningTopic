# CS271-MachineLearningTopic
CLASSIC ML topic
	Hidden Markov Model (HMM) – will cover the most in class because it useful in many application. Should compare/constrast other to HMM
	Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM)
	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) == Singular Value Decomposistion (SVD)
	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	Clustering (emphasis on K-means and EM)
	Neural Network (ANN) : backpropagation, different types (MLP, CNN …)
	Data Analysis

Mini-Topic 
	K-neareast neighbor (K-NN) 
	Boosting (adaBoost)
	Random Forests (RF)
	Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA)

Deep Learning Topic 
	Backpropagation
	Convolutional Neural Network CNN
	Erecurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
	Residual network (ResNet)
	Generative Adversarial network (GAN)
	Word2Vec, transfer learning, ensemble techniques, ELM, TF-IDF, ….
